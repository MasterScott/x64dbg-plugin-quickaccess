[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/t38uon2uf8pwm6nd?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/TheCrazyT/x64dbg-plugin-quickaccess)

Since version 1.3 there is a little configuration neccessary.
Under Favourites->Manage Favourites->Command you need to add the "quickaccess" command with the shortcut Ctrl+3(or any other shortcut) in order for the shortcut to work.

For the lazy people that can't remember all the shortcuts.
Just press ctrl+3 and you can access any menu.
Somebody might know that feature from eclipse already.
Might get some improvements later ...

Binary Releases can be found under release-tab.
